1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)PII is the broadest category. 
It refers to any data that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, 
either alone or when combined with other relevant information.
Examples: Full name, Social Security Number (SSN), driver’s license number, email address, physical address, and biometric records.
Regulations:
 Governed by various laws such as the GDPR (Europe), CCPA/CPRA (California), and various data breach notification laws.Goal: 
To protect individual privacy and prevent identity theft.


2. Personal Health Information (PHI)PHI is essentially PII specifically related to health care. 
It includes any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual.
Examples: Medical records, laboratory results, health insurance claims, mental health notes, and appointment dates.Regulations:
 In the U.S., this is strictly governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).Key Distinction:
 Data is only considered PHI when it is held by a "Covered Entity" (like a doctor, hospital, or health insurer) or their business associates.
 A step counter app you use for fun might collect "health data," but it isn't legally PHI unless it's tied to a medical provider.


3. Payment Card Information (PCI)PCI refers specifically to data related to credit, debit, and other payment cards.
 This is a private industry standard rather than a federal law, though its impact is global.Examples: Primary Account Number (PAN),
 cardholder name, expiration date, and Service Code. Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) like CVV codes and PINs also fall under this 
umbrella but have even stricter storage rules.Regulations: Governed by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS),
 maintained by the major card brands (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.).
Goal: To reduce credit card fraud and secure the global payment ecosystem.
